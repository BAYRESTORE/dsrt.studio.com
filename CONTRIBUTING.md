# Contributing to DSRT Studio

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

At the moment, this project is being built and maintained by a solo developer. Therefore:

- Pull requests are currently **not** accepted.
- For bugs, feature requests, or issues, feel free to open an **Issue**.
- Suggestions and ideas are always welcome via Discussions (if enabled).

Once the project is more stable, external contributions may be considered in the future. Thank you for your interest!
